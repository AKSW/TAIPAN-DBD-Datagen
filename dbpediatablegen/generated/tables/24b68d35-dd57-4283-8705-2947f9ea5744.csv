"47912132","NT5M","5',3'-nucleotidase, mitochondrial, also known as 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase, mitochondrial (mdN) or deoxy-5'-nucleotidase 2 (dNT-2), is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the NT5M gene. This gene encodes a 5' nucleotidase that localizes to the mitochondrial matrix. This enzyme dephosphorylates the 5'- and 2'(3')-phosphates of uracil and thymine deoxyribonucleotides. The gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17.","682741439","56953"
"47350023","RDH13","Retinol dehydrogenase 13 (all-trans/9-cis) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RDH13 gene. This gene encodes a mitochondrial short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, which catalyzes the reduction and oxidation of retinoids. The encoded enzyme may function in retinoic acid production and may also protect the mitochondria against oxidative stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.","674583373","112724"

The gene product is also associated with centrosome maturation. One version of stem cell myeloproliferative disorder is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 9, with the breakpoint associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and centriolin.","659858603",""
